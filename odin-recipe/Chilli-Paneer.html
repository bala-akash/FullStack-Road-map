          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Chilli Paneer is a popular Indo-Chinese dish that is made with
            paneer (Indian cottage cheese) that is coated with a spicy batter
            and then fried until crispy. The crispy paneer cubes are then tossed
            in a flavorful sauce made with ginger, garlic, onions, bell peppers
            and a variety of sauces like soy sauce, tomato ketchup, and red
            chilli sauce. The dish is garnished with spring onion greens and
            served hot as an appetizer or as a side dish with fried rice or
            noodles.
