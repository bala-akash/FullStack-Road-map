						<h3>Steps</h3>
						<ol>
							<li>Heat 2 tablespoons of butter in a pan over medium heat. Once the butter melts, add cubed paneer and fry until golden brown. Remove the paneer cubes from the pan and set aside.</li>
							<li>In the same pan, add finely chopped onions and saut√© until they turn translucent. Add ginger-garlic paste, slit green chilli (optional), and chopped tomatoes to the pan. Cook until the tomatoes turn soft and mushy.</li>
							<li>Once the tomato-onion mixture cools down, blend it into a smooth puree using a blender or a hand-held blender. In the same pan, heat 2 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the tomato-onion puree to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes.</li>
							<li>Add red chilli powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, and garam masala powder to the pan. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the spices are well combined and the raw smell goes away. Add salt to taste and mix well. Add cream or cashew cream to the pan and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the mixture is well combined and slightly thickened. Add the fried paneer cubes to the pan and mix well. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the paneer cubes are well coated with the sauce. Crush dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi) between your palms and sprinkle over the paneer butter masala. Add a dollop of butter or cream, if desired. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves (optional) and serve hot with naan, roti or steamed rice.</li>
						</ol>
						<h4>Notes</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>*To make cashew cream, soak cashews in hot water for 15-20 minutes and blend them into a smooth paste. Use this paste instead of cream to make the dish vegan. You can adjust the amount of spices according to your taste preferences. Increase or decrease the amount of red chilli powder or green chillies to make the dish more or less spicy. To make the dish healthier, you can use low-fat paneer or reduce the amount of butter or cream used in the recipe.</li>
						</ul>
					
						<h4>Storage</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Store in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
						</ul>
